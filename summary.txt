RemixMail would be an cloud-hosted online service to easily generate email
aliases that forward to one's real email address. Generate a unique alias for
each web registration to protect against spam.

Unsubscribing from spam is not a valid strategy as it confirms the email
address as valid and allows the address to be resold to spammers as such. Remix
Mail instead allows one to delete aliases receiving unsolicited email, cutting
off spam at the source and protecting the user's real email address.

RemixMail's website would allow one-step creation of a limited number of
aliases for free. Registered, paying users would have access to a browser
plugin to generate aliases with one click in an email input field, eliminating
the need to open a new tab or window.

Since initial creation of aliases can be done in one step by simply entering an
email address on the website, the barrier of entry for new users is very low --
there is no need for passwords or personal information from visitors. Since the
user's email address is a necessary part of the exchange, we could then focus
on converting these users to paid plans with extra features and unlimited
aliases.
